## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. I learned to center elements in the x and y axes using Bootstrap 5, for example:

```html
<div class="card-wrapper position-absolute start-50 top-50 translate-middle">
  .
  .
  .
</div>
```

2. I learned to disable content overflow from a div, using overflow: hidden:

```css
.wrapper {
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: auto;
  position: relative;
}
```

3. All in all, I think that I'm getting better at mobile-first workflow.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 Position Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/position/) - This helped me for centering elements. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
